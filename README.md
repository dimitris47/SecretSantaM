# Secret Santa

Secret Santa, when done with the conventional 'paper in hat' method is inherently problematic, because the drawing probabilities are not equally distributed among the players.
Not only that, but a practical problem arises as well: a player might draw their own name, making it necessary for the process to start from the top, often many times. Listen to [Hannah Fry](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kC5k5QBqcc) describing the problem in detail.

SecretSanta offers a software solution to the problem, using recursion to produce an equal-probabilities Secret Santa drawing for up to 99 people.

There is also a desktop version of this app, you can find it [here](https://github.com/dimitris47/secretsanta)!

Enjoy the program... and your gift!
